# Flutter Weather App

This repository contains a Flutter UI for a weather application. It provides current weather information and forecasts based on data fetched from a weather API.

## Features

*   **Current Weather:** Displays current weather conditions, including temperature, weather description, humidity, wind speed, and other relevant details.
*   **Location-Based Weather:** Fetches weather data based on the user's current location or a searched location.
*   **Forecast:** Shows a short-term (e.g., hourly or daily) weather forecast.
*   **User-Friendly Interface:** Clean and intuitive UI for easy navigation and information display.
*   **API Integration:** Uses a weather API (specify which one, e.g., OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI) to retrieve weather data.






## Technologies Used

*   Flutter
*   Dart
*   [Specify the weather API used, e.g., weatherapi API]
*   [List any other relevant packages, e.g.:]
    *   `http` or `dio` (for making API requests)
    *   `geolocator` (for getting device location)
    *   `intl` (for date/time formatting)
    *   `flutter_svg` (for displaying SVG icons)

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [invalid URL removed]
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

4.  **Obtain an API key (if required):**


    *   This app uses the [weatherapi]. You will need an API key to use it.
    *   Go to [Link to API provider's website, e.g.,https://www.weatherapi.com/] and create an account (if you don't have one).
    *   Follow their instructions to obtain an API key.

5.  **Configure the API key in the app:**

    **(Explain how to add the API key to your Flutter project. Common methods include:)**

    *   **Using environment variables (recommended for security):**
        *   Create a `.env` file in the root of your project.
        *   Add your API key to the `.env` file like this:
            ```
            WEATHER_API_KEY=YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY
            ```
        *   Use a package like `flutter_dotenv` to load the environment variables.
    *   **(Less secure, but simpler for very basic projects):** Directly in the code (NOT RECOMMENDED for production apps):
        *   Locate the file where the API call is made (e.g., `weather_service.dart`).
        *   Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual key:
            ```dart
            final apiKey = 'YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY'; // NOT RECOMMENDED
            ```

6.  **Connect a device or start an emulator:**

7.  **Run the app:**

    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```

## How to Use

1.  Upon launching the app, it will attempt to get your current location (you may need to grant location permissions).
2.  The current weather information for your location will be displayed.
3.  [If you have search functionality:] You can search for weather information in other locations by entering a city name or zip code.
4.  [If you have forecast functionality:] Tap on the forecast section to view the upcoming weather forecast.

## API Usage

This app uses the [https://www.weatherapi.com/] to fetch weather data. The API provides endpoints for current weather data and forecasts.
